    <h1> JJ Thompson Cathode Ray Tube Experiment <object data = "C:\Users\ydung\Desktop\data\grade9_science\ch 3 - atoms and molecules\atom_icom.svg" type = "image/svg+xml" width = "80" height = "80" style="vertical-align:middle" ></object></h1>

    <p>In this classic experiment, JJ Thompson made use of a cathode ray tube.</p>
    
    <p> You can think of the cathode ray tube as a sealed glass tube, inside which are two oppositely charged electrodes.</p>
    <p> A high voltage current is applied across the two electrodes. Because most of the air inside the tube has been sucked out you can see the flow of particles between the cathode and the anode. 
      The rays originating from the cathode are called "cathode rays". </p>
    <p>JJ Thompson was among the first people to suggest that the particles in these cathode rays are actually electrons - which carry a negative charge and are much smaller than an atom.</p>
    
  
<h2>Experiment</h2>
<p><b>Read the instructions below carefully.</b></p>
     <p>Have a look at the setup below.</p>
     <p>Here you have a cathode and an anode.</p>
     <p>1.You can click on the circle in the cathode, which will show you the path of the electrons between the two electrodes.</p>
     <p>2.Next, you can try placing magnets around the cathode tube, by clicking  (twice)on the "Place magnets" button.</p>
     <p>Once you have the magnets in place, do you think the path of the electrons will change?</p>
     <p>Because electrons have a negative charge they will be repelled by the negative pole of the magnet and attracted to the positive pole.</p>

     <p>3.Click on the "Deflected electrons" button and then click on the electron in the cathode again. You will see the path of the electron has now changed.</p>
